# Overview

This folder contains scripts and installable programs that I find useful.

## Installation

To install:

```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, all programs in the `programs/` directory will be available from the commandline

## Local scripts

Scripts in the root of this folder can be run locally without installing the package.
