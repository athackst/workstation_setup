# Scripts

This folder contains scripts and installable programs that I find useful.

## Installation

To install:

```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, all programs in this directory will be available from the commandline.

## Utilities

Utility scripts in the `utilities` folder can be run locally and are not installed with this package.
