# Overview

This folder contains scripts and installable programs that I find useful.

## Structure

- `programs/`: This directory contains programs that are installed when you install the package
- `/`: The root of this folder contains scripts that can be run locally without installation.

## Installation

To install to make all programs in the `programs/` directory available:

```bash
pip install .
```

After installation, all programs in the `programs/` directory will be available from the commandline

## Local scripts

Scripts in the root of this folder can be run locally without installing the package.
